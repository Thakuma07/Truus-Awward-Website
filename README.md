## 🚀 Overview

This project is a high-fidelity clone of the Truus advertising agency website. It captures the bold aesthetics, playful interactivity, and smooth motion design that are characteristic of Awwward-winning websites. The codebase is built with vanilla technologies to ensure maximum performance and control over every frame of animation.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Dynamic Navigation System**: Context-aware navbar that automatically adapts its color theme (light/dark) based on the current scroll section.
-   **Elastic Card Interactions**: Custom GSAP-powered hover effects on service cards, featuring horizontal repulsion, elastic scaling, and smooth clustering.
-   **Dual-Direction Randomized Marquees**: An infinite scrolling logo section with randomized brand placement and background colors for a fresh experience on every visit.
-   **Scroll-Triggered SVG Animations**: Hand-drawn style underlines and path animations that reveal themselves as the user explores the page.
-   **High-End Typography**: Integration of premium variable fonts (*Epilogue* and *DM Sans*) for a brutalist yet polished look.
-   **Interactive Micro-details**: 
    -   Visibility-triggered tab titles ("Hey, over here!👋") to re-engage users.
    -   Haptic-style wiggling social icons.
    -   Custom cursor implementation.
-   **Responsive & Semantic**: built with clean HTML5 and modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid/Variables) for a solid foundation.

## 🛠️ Built With

-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Native styling using CSS Variables for an easy-to-manage design system.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Custom logic for DOM manipulation and dynamic state management.
-   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: The core engine for all sophisticated timing and motion.
-   **ScrollTrigger**: For orchestration of animations linked to the user's scroll progress.
